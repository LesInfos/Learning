Am I learning? Or is the the machine?

Repository of tutorials and projects which explored fundamental 'machine learning' concepts (including Linear Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, SVM, K Means) and their applications.
Originally started in Fall 2018, now reuploaded.
Includes (modified) project from UCB's CS61A which incorporates supervised (K Nearest Neighbors) and unsupervised (K Means) learning algorithms to create a map of restaurants and food reccomendations.
